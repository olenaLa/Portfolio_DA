## 1. First project: COVID-19 Data Analysis SQL Scripts
This repository contains SQL scripts for analyzing COVID-19 data using the MySQL database. The scripts are designed to work with COVID-19-related tables named "covid19.covid" and "covid19.coviddeaths." These scripts offer insights into COVID-19 statistics, population, vaccinations, and more.

 ## Scripts Description
  - Basic Data Retrieval:
  - COVID-19 Statistics Analysis:
    - Queries to analyze and visualize COVID-19 statistics in Europe.
      Percentage of total cases vs. total deaths in Europe.
      Percentage of total cases vs. population in Europe.
      Countries with the highest infection rate to population.
      Countries with the highest death count per population.
      Continents with the highest death count per population.
  - Data Cleaning and Updates:
      Identifies empty values in the "continent" column and updates them based on conditions.
      Cleans and updates data for better analysis.
  - Vaccination Data Analysis:
      Analyzes vaccination data and calculates the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID vaccine.
      Uses temporary tables for data transformation and calculation.
      Creates a view to store data for later visualizations.
